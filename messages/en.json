          "content": "NPKS fertilizers include sulfur (S) in their composition, which further increases the efficiency of plant absorption of nutrients. This improves resistance to stress and contributes to the formation of a high-quality harvest.

          "content": "Complex NPK fertilizers (containing nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) play an important role in plant development, since these three elements are the main macronutrients necessary for plant health and normal growth. Complex NPK fertilizers are formulated to provide the optimal ratio of these three essential macronutrients, meeting the plants' needs for each. By adjusting the nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium levels in the soil, you can support healthy plant growth, improve crop quality and increase resistance to stress."

The addition of humic acids to the composition enriches the soil, improving its structure and stimulating microbiological activity. This integrated approach provides plants not only with the necessary elements, but also with favorable conditions for their optimal growth. Organomineral fertilizers with humic acids are complex fertilizers that combine organic and mineral components, including humic acids. "
